Hi! My name is Jolande and I just succesfully made this site. Finally. After having a run-in with git submodules. Again.  
  
I wanted to try out some R code to see if this all works correctly:
```{r}
data("iris")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
head(iris)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species))
```
  
Since that all seems to work fine, I think I can update my categories and so forth.
